# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to identify which factors make a project's campaign successful.
## Overview of Project
An upcoming playwright, Louise, wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play. "Fever." Louise is estimating a budget of $10,000. She needs help to determine whether specific factors make a project's campaign successful.
### Purpose
We will use crowdfunding data to help Louise better understand and plan her campaign. We will provide Louise with visualized feedback with the input she needs to mirror other successful campaigns in the same category.
## Analysis and challenges
We initially contrasted data from Louise's Theather campaign category with campaigns from other categories to determine their overall success. The following graph shows that campaigns in the theater category were the most successful in the United States. Of 912 campaigns in the theater category, 525 were successful, 58%, 349 failed, 38%, 26 were canceled, 3%, and 12, 1% were live when the data was gathered.

The theater category has three subcategories: musicals, plays, and spaces. So we unraveled the data further to find out how the play's subcategory compares to musicals and spaces. After filtering the information, we identified that 412 play campaigns were successful, compared to 45 for musicals and 68 for spaces. The graph below shows how the plays subcategory makes up most of the theater campaigns. Of 671 play campaigns, 412 (61%) were successful, 250 (37%) failed, 15 (2%) were canceled, and three were live at the time the data was collected
